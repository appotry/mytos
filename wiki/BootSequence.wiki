= POST（自检） =

When a computer is switched on or reset, it runs through a series of diagnostics called POST - Power-On Self-Test. Part of this sequence is the scanning for a bootable device.

当计算机启动或重置时，它要运行一系列的自检工作。

Old computers would always look for a bootable floppy disk in drive A:\ first, then for a bootable partition on drive C:\. Modern BIOS' allow to configure a scan sequence (e.g., "C, SCSI, A").
